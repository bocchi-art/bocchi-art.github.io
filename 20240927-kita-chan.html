      <h3>Bocchi's Comments</h3>
      <p>I wanted to draw Kita-chan since she's one of my favourite characters from Bocchi the Rock. Having her taking a selfie felt in character for her and it would let me practice hands without it feeling like practice lol</p>
      <p>I think it turned out pretty good, my faces are getting better and the uniform was decent for my first attempt at clothes</p>
      <p>The left hand looks kinda flat and the right hand doesn't really make sense lol. I did find it difficult trying to draw her hand holding the phone; I should probably use a reference next time</p>
      <p>Just realising now but should probably make the eyebrows thinner in the future too</p>
